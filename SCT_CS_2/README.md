### Pixel Image Encryption Tool ðŸ”’

A simple Python tool to demonstrate basic image encryption by manipulating pixel values. This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity internship to explore low-level data manipulation and symmetric encryption principles.

#### Features âœ¨
* **Two Encryption Methods:** Supports both a basic **XOR cipher** and **pixel channel swapping** (RGB to GBR).
* **Simple Reversible Logic:** Both encryption methods are easily reversible, demonstrating core symmetric encryption concepts.
* **Pillow Library:** Utilizes the popular Pillow library for efficient image processing.
* **Error Handling:** The script includes robust error handling for file operations.

#### How to Use ðŸš€
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python and the Pillow library installed. If not, run `pip install Pillow`.
2.  **Run the Script:** Place an image file (e.g., `my_image.png`) in the same directory as the script.
3.  **Execute:** Run the script from your terminal: `python image_encryptor.py`
4.  **Output:** The program will generate encrypted and swapped versions of your image in the same directory.
